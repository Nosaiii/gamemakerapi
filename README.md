# GameMakerAPI

An API that can be used to develop minigames in a Spigot project.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of GameMakerAPI up and running on your local machine for use as an API during the development of your own project.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to run a build of HexRPG yourself.

* [Java Development Kit 8](https://www.oracle.com/nl/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) - The JDK development environment for building applications
* An IDE which allows programming in Java
* An installation of Git on your local machine for version control
* An installation of Maven and Gradle for building the GameMakerAPI project

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that will tell you how to get a development environment running.

First, open up your command prompt and navigate (using the `cd` command) to a folder where you would like to clone the repository to.
```
cd "C:\IntelliJ-projects\"
```

Then, run the `git clone` command using this repository to download all necessary files for the source code of GameMakerAPI, by doing so:
```
git clone https://github.com/Nosaiii/gamemakerapi GameMakerAPI
```

Now open up your IDE, load the project by navigating to the folder you just created. Then, run the `package` script of Maven. Maven will build the project into a .jar file in the `target` folder. Use that .jar file to make use of GameMakerAPI in your local project.
